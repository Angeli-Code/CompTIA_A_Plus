# Lab 1.1.9: Connecting Internal Components
Date: 10/30/2024

### Professional Task Given:
You were recently hired as a network technician for a small corporate network. Your new manager has just asked you to add two new network cards to a computer currently in Office 2. These cards will be used to connect to a test network at a later time. You have also been asked to test the UPS, which is providing power to the Networking Closet.

On the Office2 computer, your task is to:

- Power off the Office2 computer and install two new network adapter cards.
- Install the PCIe network adapter in a free PCIe (x1) slot.
- Install the PCI network adapter in a free PCI slot.

While installing the network cards, keep the following in mind:
- PCI Express (PCIe) slots have different sizes. x1 slots are the smallest slots on the motherboard.
- PCI slots are typically white and have a notch or division within the slot off to the right-hand side.
- PCIe x1
- PCIe x1 slot image
- PCI
- PCI slot image
- Install a networking cable between the wall plate and the computer.
- When you make the connection to the wall plate, use the port with the computer symbol embossed on the red box. This is the network port in Office 2.
- When you make the connection to the computer, use the built-in network adapter on the motherboard or one of the recently installed network adapters in the expansion slots.
- After you install the network adapters, turn the computer on.
- Using the Settings app, verify that the computer has a connection to the network and internet.

On the CorpServer computer, your task is to:

- Test to see if the uninterruptable power supplies are functioning properly in the Networking Closet.
- Remove both power cables from the wall plate. (These are for the rack-mounted UPSs.)
- Ensure that the power and activity lights for the rack-mounted networking devices are still on and flickering.

### Issues and Troubleshooting
- Issue[0]: Unfamiliar with Network Racks. Never worked with these before so this did not come as easily to me when performing the lab.

### Solutions
- Solution[0]: Spend time trying to memorize the visual aid in the Test-Out content for a server rack.

### Conclusion
- This lab introduced a new piece of technology being Network Racks. I need to spend more time looking at them not only in the virtual environment but also see if I can
see the components in real life images. I am sure that it is not that difficult and can easily be learned through more exposure with working on network racks.

### Additional Notes
- Check out if Network Racks all have the same layout Top Down. Check for Universal Standard.
